The Naive Approach assumes feature independence, meaning that the presence or absence of a particular feature does not affect the presence or absence of other features.

The Naive Approach can handle missing values by either ignoring the missing instances during model training or by assigning a special value to represent missing data. During classification, if a feature value is missing, it is typically ignored and not used in the probability calculation.\\n\\n4. Advantages of the Naive Approach include its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to handle high-dimensional data.

However, its main disadvantage is the strong assumption of feature independence, which may not hold in many real-world problems.

The Naive Approach is primarily designed for classification problems, where the goal is to assign a class label to an instance.

Laplace smoothing, also known as add-one smoothing, is used in the Naive Approach to handle situations where a feature value in the test data has not been observed in the training data.
